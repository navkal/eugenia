<p class="column2">
In August 2013, I began consulting with <a href="http://titagyaschools.org/">Titagya Schools</a>, a nonprofit based working in rural villages in Ghana. Titagya had just trained 27 teachers on individualized teaching and student engagement, and were trying to understand how to assess the success of the training and implementation. This was Titagya’s first attempt to understand the impact of their training program.
<br><br>
I worked with Titagya to develop a strategy for effective follow-up and understanding impact. I created a guide for effective interviewing, a process document, and a questionnaire that would ask about the key points of the training and assess teacher comprehension.
</p>
<h5>"Eugenia advised my NGO, Titagya Schools, in 2013 about impact assessment for a teacher-training program we were launching. Titagya Schools is a social enterprise dedicated to improving the quality of early education in northern Ghana and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
<br><br>
After having initial conversations about the teacher-training program and our needs, Eugenia wrote a report for us about using questionnaires and interviews for evaluation, as well as other general considerations regarding follow-up. With her anthropology and international development experience, she contributed numerous high-impact insights to our work, and we’re planning to implement her recommendations. Throughout the process, I found Eugenia to be a friendly, highly-capable professional.  I was especially impressed by her openness to incorporating new considerations, as well as by her focus on tailoring her recommendations to Titagya’s capabilities. I would wholeheartedly suggest Eugenia’s services to anyone who is considering working with her! Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk more about her work."
