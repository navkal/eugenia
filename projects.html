<h5>"I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be."

My interests range widely, from nonprofit work to social entrepreneurship to writing, and more. Here are a few of the things I spend my time on.

<ul id="categories" class="section">

<h3>Field Training Program</h3>

<p align="justify" hspace="10">
<br>How do we prepare for crucial research work abroad? Currently, there is no curriculum or training program in existence that develops the situational awareness skills that young professionals need with how to conduct effective qualitative and quantitative field work abroad. With the <a href="http://fpri.org">Foreign Policy Research Institute</a> and <a href="http://www.danelo.com">David Danelo</a>, I've developed a curriculum and train young professionals and students interested in doing research in dangerous or politically unstable climates. We train on security, situational awareness, field work methods, and storytelling.

<h3>LEAP</h3>

<p align="justify">

<br>In 2012, in partnership with a local community-based organization called Lepta Community, I began working with a year-long leadership development program called LEAP. This program is geared towards underprivileged but promising young leaders from the Mathare slum. I taught weekly classes on social entrepreneurship, developing creativity, innovation, and change. Currently, I offer curriculum support, provide mentorship and insights where necessary, and advise on strategic growth.
